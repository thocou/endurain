class SecurityHeadersMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):
    """
    Middleware to add security headers to all HTTP responses.

    This middleware adds essential security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities:
    - XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
    - Clickjacking
    - MIME sniffing attacks
    - Information leakage through referrer
    - Unauthorized feature access

    Headers added:
        X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
            Prevents MIME sniffing attacks by forcing browsers to respect declared content types.

        X-Frame-Options: DENY
            Prevents clickjacking attacks by disallowing the page to be embedded in iframes.

        X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
            Enables browser's XSS filter and blocks page rendering if XSS attack detected.
            (Legacy header but still supported by older browsers)

        Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
            Controls how much referrer information is sent with requests:
            - Same origin: full URL
            - Cross origin: only origin (no path/query)
            - HTTPS to HTTP: no referrer

        Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
            Disables unnecessary browser features to reduce attack surface.
            Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive device APIs.

        Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data: <dynamic-tile-domains>; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
            Restricts resources to same origin by default (API responses).
            Allows inline base64 images (data: URIs) and map tiles from configured tile servers.
            Tile domains are dynamically loaded from app.state.allowed_tile_domains (updated on startup and settings changes).
            Allows inline styles and scripts required by frontend libraries.
            For frontend serving, this would need customization.

    Note:
        These headers are applied globally to all responses.
        Individual endpoints can override headers if needed via response objects.
